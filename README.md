A submission for Nasa Space Apps 2021

**Challenge**: When Light Curves Throw Us Curve Balls

**Team**: Sam Sucks

Team Sam Sucks selected the light curve challenge. In order to fulfill the requirements, the team developed a web-app which produces light curves from Earth's perspective for objects orbiting the sun. The app allows a user to select a model from a drop down menu, enter generic settings for the simulation including orbital period and the radius of orbit (using simplified, circular orbits) as well as the rotational speed of the model, and finally scaling settings for the simulation window. A simulation is produced and displayed. The light intensity from the object is calculated based on pixel brightness, and is made available for the user to plot and view at any point during the sim.

## Hosted instance

An instance of *jo* is hosted to allow users to try the software without having to install it from source.

## Local installation

*jo* can be installed and developed on locally using npm. Steps to setup a local development environment are listed below.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Data used:

In total, our team used nine different asteroids models, as well as the MKIII spacesuit model, in order to demo our web-app. "
